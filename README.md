# Time Series Analysis and Prediction of Exchange Rates using Python (Jupyter Notebook)

### Description

These notbooks are from the **Financial Data Base** course held in KAIST Business School in the Summer of 2024 as part of DFMBA program, which I had the opportunity to audit.

The Lecturor is Phd. Jaehoon Lee, a former professor at the University of New South Wales Business School and now working at KAIST Business School.

In this class, below topics are covered:

1. Basic Pandas skills for Data Analysis
2. Time Series Analysis with Python
3. Using and reading data from Bank of Korea, Bloomberg, Eikon data, etc.
4. Basic international finance theories around exchange rates

I tried to make each Notebook file as comprehensive as possible. 

Each note is mainly for my own reference but I am confident anyone struggling with pandas basics and trying to learn python time series analysis skills would benefit from it as well.

Enjoy! :)
