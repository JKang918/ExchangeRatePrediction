# Time Series Analysis and Prediction of Exchange Rates using Python (Jupyter Notebook)

### Description

These notbooks are from the **Financial Data Base** course held in KAIST Business School in the Summer of 2024 as part of DFMBA program, which I had an opportunity to audit.

The Lecturor is Phd. Jaehoon Lee, a former professor at the University of New South Wales Business School and now working at KAIST Business School.

### Final Project

In the final project, I aimed to build a model to predict the exchange rate (KRW/USD) one year ahead, based on macroeconomic data from South Korea and the United States, and to present both point estimates and interval estimates of the exchange rate one year later.

The project is organized as below:

1. Presentation of fundamental theories as to exchange rate regarding selecting right variables.
2. Brief explanation on selecting OLS regression over ARIMA or other machine learning models.
3. Downloading data from Bank of Korea, Federal Reserve, and World Bank using custom functions.
4. Loading the downloaded data onto Jupyter Notebook using custom functions.
5. Data preprocessing: difference, divide, or normalize data for stationarity. Get new data from existing data.
6. Modeling: correlation matrix, visual analytics, variable selection with AIC
7. Interpretation of the result.
