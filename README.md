# Time Series Analysis and Prediction of Exchange Rates using Python (Jupyter Notebook)

### Description

These notbooks are from the **Financial Data Base** course held in KAIST Business School in the Summer of 2024 as part of DFMBA program, which I had an opportunity to audit.

The Lecturor is Phd. Jaehoon Lee, a former professor at the University of New South Wales Business School and now working at KAIST Business School.

In this class, below topics are covered:

1. Basic Pandas skills for Data Analysis
2. Time Series Analysis with Python
3. Using and reading data from Bank of Korea, Bloomberg, Eikon data, etc.
4. Basic international finance theories around exchange rates

The numbered files are lecture notes.

I tried to make each Notebook file as comprehensive as possible. 

Each note is mainly for my own reference but I am confident anyone struggling with pandas basics and trying to learn python time series analysis skills would benefit from it as well.


In addition to that, I also plan to add two project files. One is predicting KRW/USD rates and the other one is predicting KRW and JPY rates. Each projects covers exchange rate theories, data importing and cleansing, visualization and forecasting with statistical models.
